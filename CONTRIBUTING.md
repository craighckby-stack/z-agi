# Contributing to Z-AI

## Research Philosophy

This project prioritizes:
1. **Empirical validation** over theoretical claims
2. **Honest reporting** of results (positive and negative)
3. **Scientific rigor** in experimental design
4. **Transparent limitations** in what the system can/cannot do

- Design better baseline comparisons

### Documentation
- Document limitations and edge cases
- Improve clarity of research claims
- Add examples and tutorials
- Enhance experimental documentation
- Create replication guides

## What We Don't Accept

### Claims Without Evidence
