# Contributing to Z AGI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Z AGI! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Philosophy

Z AGI represents a fundamentally different approach to AGI development based on constraint-based consciousness emergence. We welcome contributions that align with this philosophy and help advance the research.

## Areas of Contribution

### 1. Constraint System Development

**What we need**: New constraint types, evaluation methods, and optimization algorithms

**Examples**:
- Domain-specific constraints (medical, legal, scientific)
- Adaptive constraint systems that learn from context
- Multi-level constraint hierarchies
- Constraint conflict resolution mechanisms

**How to contribute**:
1. Design constraint evaluation logic
2. Add constraint type to the system
3. Implement violation detection
4. Add tests and documentation

### 2. Developmental Stage Research

**What we need**: Enhanced stage-appropriate behaviors and transition mechanisms

**Examples**:
- More sophisticated baby AGI exploration patterns
- Enhanced child AGI question-asking algorithms
- Improved teenage AGI emotional regulation
- Advanced mature AGI wisdom synthesis

**How to contribute**:
1. Research developmental psychology
2. Design stage-specific behaviors
3. Implement transition logic
4. Test and validate progression

### 3. Consciousness Theory Implementation

**What we need**: Exploration of N=3 consciousness hypothesis and alternatives

**Examples**:
- N=4 or higher consciousness architectures
- Alternative consciousness loop configurations
- Consciousness measurement metrics
- Self-reference implementation methods

**How to contribute**:
1. Study consciousness theories
2. Design experimental implementations
3. Create measurement tools
4. Document findings and results

### 4. Safety and Alignment

**What we need**: Enhanced safety mechanisms and alignment research

**Examples**:
- Advanced safety constraint systems
- Alignment through developmental approaches
- Ethical reasoning frameworks
- Harm prevention mechanisms

**How to contribute**:
1. Research AI safety literature
2. Design safety mechanisms
3. Implement ethical constraints
4. Test safety effectiveness

### 5. Memory and Learning Systems

**What we need**: Improved memory architecture and learning algorithms

**Examples**:
- Enhanced knowledge graph structures
- Long-term memory consolidation
- Forgetting and importance weighting
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer

**How to contribute**:
1. Study memory systems research
2. Design memory architectures
3. Implement learning algorithms
4. Optimize performance and scalability

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/z-agi.git
   cd z-agi
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Create development branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash

   ```

5. **Make changes and test**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Test the system thoroughly
   - Update documentation as needed

## Code Style and Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript mode
- Provide proper type definitions
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes

### React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Follow React best practices

### Code Organization

- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use clear naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing folder structure

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Document test scenarios

## Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation**
   - Update README if needed
   - Add API documentation for new features
   - Update theory documentation with findings

2. **Create pull request**
   - Use clear, descriptive title
   - Describe changes and their purpose
   - Link to relevant issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

3. **Code review**
   - Respond to review comments promptly
   - Make requested changes
   - Ensure all checks pass
   - Keep PR up to date

### Commit Guidelines

- Use conventional commit messages
- Examples: `feat: add new constraint type`, `fix: resolve memory leak`
- One feature or fix per commit
- Include issue numbers when relevant
