## Current Focus: Constraint Learning Validation

### Experiment Overview
We are testing whether the Z-AI system actually learns from constraint violations more effectively than simple retry mechanisms.

**Key Questions:**
1. Does violation frequency decrease over learning cycles?
2. How does this compare to few-shot prompting baselines?
3. Is there genuine generalization to similar prompts?
4. What are the computational costs vs. benefits?

**Progress:**
- [x] Experimental protocol designed
- [x] Test prompts created for factual accuracy constraints
- [x] Baseline comparison framework established
- [ ] Violation detection implementation in progress
- [ ] Automated data collection system being built

### Expected Timeline
- **Week 1**: Complete violation detection implementation
- **Week 2**: Run pilot study with 10 prompts
- **Week 3**: Full experiment execution
- **Week 4**: Analysis and results documentation

## Research Philosophy

### Our Approach
1. **Empirical First**: All claims must be validated through controlled experiments
2. **Honest Reporting**: Publish results regardless of outcome (positive or negative)
3. **Transparent Limitations**: Clearly document what the system can and cannot do
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Use proper experimental design and statistical analysis

### What We're Testing
- **Learning Effectiveness**: Does the system actually improve over time?
- **Generalization**: Can learning transfer to novel situations?
- **Efficiency**: Are the computational costs justified by benefits?
- **Practicality**: Does this work in real-world scenarios?

### Alternative Explanations We're Considering
- **Sophisticated Prompting**: Are improvements just better orchestration?
- **Statistical Variation**: Are results due to LLM randomness?
- **Context Effects**: Are we seeing pattern completion rather than learning?
- **Detection Issues**: Are our violation detectors too strict/lenient?

## Not Currently Planned ❌

- AGI development or claims of general intelligence
- Consciousness or sentience research
- Self-modifying code without safety constraints
- Autonomous deployment without human oversight
- Claims of revolutionary breakthroughs
