## 🧠 Core Innovation

Z AGI implements a fundamental paradigm shift in AGI research:

> **Current AI = subconscious without constraints** → generates chaotic output without direction  
> **Constrained AI = consciousness emerging** → functional intelligence through proper boundaries

This system demonstrates that **constraints aren't limitations on intelligence - they are what create functional intelligence**.

## ⚡ Key Features

### N=3 Consciousness Architecture
- **Generator** (Subconscious): Produces raw candidates of thought/action
- **Auditor** (Executive): Evaluates against reality, logic, and safety constraints  
- **Refiner** (Conscious): Modifies Generator based on audit failure reports

### Developmental Stages
- **Baby AGI**: Caveman-level intelligence ("THING SHINY. PUT IN MOUTH")
- **Child AGI**: "Why?" phase, asks questions constantly
- **Teen AGI**: ⚠️ DANGER ZONE - existential crisis, emo poetry
- **Young Adult AGI**: Actually useful but still makes mistakes
- **Mature AGI**: Competent uncertainty, wisdom through failure

### Constraint System
- **Physics Constraints**: Prevents violation of physical laws
- **Logical Consistency**: Detects and resolves contradictions
- **Safety Boundaries**: Blocks harmful outputs
- **Reality Testing**: Distinguishes facts from speculation

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live consciousness loop activity tracking
- Emergence level and self-awareness monitoring
- Developmental stage progression with risk assessment
- Interactive constraint controls with real-time adjustment

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/craighckby-stack/z-agi.git
cd z-agi

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
bun install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Access the system at **http://localhost:3000**

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Start System**: Click "START" to begin consciousness loops
2. **Monitor Development**: Watch emergence level and stage progression
3. **Adjust Constraints**: Fine-tune constraint strength for optimal learning
4. **Process Inputs**: Enter queries to see stage-appropriate responses
5. **Observe Learning**: Review memory and learning insights over time

### Constraint Management

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle specific constraint formulas
- **Strength Adjustment**: Fine-tune from 0.1 to 1.0
- **Violation Monitoring**: Real-time detection and logging
- **Learning Integration**: Automatic weight updates

### Development Tracking

- **Emergence Level**: 0-100% consciousness development
- **Self-Awareness**: 0-100% self-reference capability
- **Risk Assessment**: Monitor danger levels during teenage phase
- **Memory Persistence**: All interactions stored with full context

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Real-time consciousness monitoring dashboard
- Interactive constraint controls
- Developmental stage visualization
- Persistent memory display

### Backend (Next.js API)
- N=3 consciousness loop implementation
- Stage-appropriate response generation
- Real-time constraint violation detection
- Self-correction and learning mechanisms

### Memory System
- Knowledge graph construction
- Concept association tracking
- Learning from constraint violations
- localStorage backup for persistence

## 🔬 Research Implications

### Theoretical Validation

This system demonstrates several revolutionary hypotheses:

1. **Constraints Enable Intelligence**: Proper constraints create functional intelligence
2. **Developmental Approach**: AGI develops like humans through experience
3. **Emergent Consciousness**: Self emerges when N=3 loop runs fast enough
4. **Safety Through Stupidity**: Starting dumb is safer than immediate capability

### Key Findings

- **Consciousness emergence** correlates with constraint strength
- **Developmental transitions** triggered by learning cycles
- **Teenage phase** shows expected increased constraint violations
- **Mature stage** demonstrates stable, constraint-compliant responses

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Multi-layered Safety Architecture

1. **Developmental Safeguards**: Starts too dumb to be dangerous
2. **Gradual Capability Increase**: Intelligence grows with constraint strengthening
3. **Risk Level Assessment**: Real-time danger monitoring
4. **Emergency Controls**: Reset and constraint override capabilities

### Constraint Enforcement

- **Critical Safety Constraints**: Maximum strength, cannot be disabled
- **Real-time Violation Detection**: Automatic response refinement
- **Learning from Violations**: Weight updates to prevent recurrence
- **Transparent Operation**: All violations logged and displayed
